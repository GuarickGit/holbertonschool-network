# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser?

This is a classic interview question, and for good reason: it touches almost every layer of the modern web stack. From networking to security to servers and databases, the path your request takes is a fascinating journey. Let’s walk through it step by step.

## Step 1: DNS Request
When you type `https://www.google.com` into your browser, the first step is to translate that human-friendly name into a machine-friendly IP address. This is done through the **Domain Name System (DNS)**.

- Your computer first checks its local cache.
- If not found, the request goes to a **DNS resolver** (usually provided by your ISP or services like Google DNS or Cloudflare).
- The resolver may contact root servers, top-level domain servers (.com), and authoritative servers for `google.com` until it finds the correct IP address.

At the end of this process, your browser knows the IP address of Google’s servers.

---

## Step 2: TCP/IP
Armed with the IP address, your browser initiates a **TCP connection** with the server.

- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures a reliable, ordered, and error-checked data stream.
- A **3-way handshake** occurs: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK.
- This happens on top of IP (Internet Protocol), which handles addressing and routing.

Now a communication channel is established.

---

## Step 3: Firewall
On the way, **firewalls** inspect packets.

- On your machine, the firewall may block suspicious outgoing requests.
- On Google’s side, firewalls prevent unwanted or malicious traffic.

Only allowed packets (like those on port 443 for HTTPS) make it through.

---

## Step 4: HTTPS / SSL
Because you typed `https://`, your browser must establish a secure connection.

- A **TLS/SSL handshake** takes place.
- The server provides its **digital certificate** to prove its identity.
- Your browser verifies this certificate against trusted Certificate Authorities.
- Once verified, both sides agree on encryption keys.

From here, all communication is encrypted, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

---

## Step 5: Load Balancer
Google doesn’t serve billions of users from a single machine. Instead, your request hits a **load balancer**.

- It distributes traffic across multiple servers.
- It improves performance, ensures high availability, and provides failover if a server goes down.

This is why Google feels so fast and reliable.

---

## Step 6: Web Server
The load balancer forwards your request to a **web server** (such as Nginx or a custom Google-built server).

- The web server handles the incoming HTTPS request.
- It parses the headers, cookies, and parameters.
- Then, it forwards the request to the correct application service.

---

## Step 7: Application Server
Next, the **application server** takes over.

- For Google Search, this involves processing your query, running algorithms, and preparing results.
- It may call multiple backend services, microservices, or APIs.

This is the “brains” behind what you see.

---

## Step 8: Database
To provide results, the application server queries massive **databases** and indexes.

- Google’s search index is distributed across thousands of machines.
- Advanced algorithms rank and filter results.

The response is then packaged into an HTML page.

---

## The Return Trip
Finally, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are sent back over the secure TCP connection, through firewalls, to your browser.

- Your browser parses the HTML.
- It builds the **DOM** (Document Object Model).
- CSS styles are applied, and JavaScript code runs.
- The Google homepage renders on your screen.

All of this happens in a fraction of a second.

## Conclusion
What seems like a simple action—typing `https://www.google.com` and pressing Enter—triggers an incredibly complex sequence of events. DNS resolution, TCP/IP, firewalls, encryption, load balancing, web servers, application logic, and databases all work together to deliver the page.

The next time you hit Enter, you’ll know the hidden magic powering the web.
